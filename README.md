# Hallöchen! 👋

This is dagmtz, writing to you from somewhere in the past. Want to know about me?

```C
struct human dagmtz = {
    .name = "Daniel Martínez",
    .age = 28,
    .birthplace = "Oaxaca, Mexico",
    .likes = ["🧗", "🏊", "🏃‍➡️", "🏕", "🐧💻", "☕", "🎹", "🎸", "🖋"],
    .speaks = ["Español", "English", "Deutsch", "Française"],
    .codes = ["C/C++", "sh". "Python", "Rust"]
};
```

This is my personal space, which (as of 2025) I've left a little bit forgotten. However, during my last years I've been writing a lot of code, not to any repo,
sadly, so I'm currently doing a cleanup and sync of my projects. I do a lot of C, mostly for embedded systems, so, you can expect me to add mostly some C, Python, and Shell projects in the near future. Who knows? Maybe I try some other stuff in the meanwhile.
